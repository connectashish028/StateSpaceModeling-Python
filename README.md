# State Space Modeling and System Analysis with Python

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook exploring state space modeling for both continuous and discrete systems using Python. It covers:

**Key Concepts:**

* **State Space Representations:** Defining systems using matrices (A, B, C, D) to represent their dynamics.
* **SISO & MIMO Systems:** Modeling single-input single-output and multiple-input multiple-output systems.
* **Transfer Function Conversion:**  Demonstrates how to convert between state space and transfer function representations.
* **Practical Application:** Includes a simulation of a mass-spring-damper system using state space modeling.

**Tools & Libraries:**

* **NumPy:** For numerical computations.
* **SciPy:** For signal processing and control system analysis.
* **Matplotlib:** For data visualization.

**How to Use:**

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/[repository-name].git`
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook: `StateSpaceModeling.ipynb`
3. Run the code cells to explore the concepts and examples.

**Inspiration:**

This notebook was inspired by the excellent content on the YouTube channel "Industrial IT and Automation" by Hans-Petter Halvorsen. Check out his channel for more in-depth tutorials and explanations on control systems and automation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr8Ssxk59Ps
